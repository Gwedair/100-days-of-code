 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 08, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started getting back into android development in order to gain some knowledge about the current android design and to do own apps in the future. 
Goal for the next days: A simple fortune cookie application which crawls fortune cookie sayings and pushes them to the user as notifications. But first the basics again.

**Thoughts** Though I already created an application for my bachelor thesis this is harder than I thought. My previous work has been for Android 4.2 now I am using 7 upwards. 
This will need some hard work to get back into android and programming in general. Feels good to be at least a bit productive in the free time and I feel like I forgot lots of my knowledge during the last years.

No links to work yet, as soon as there is a basic structure will probably upload it. 

### Day 2: January 09, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Did not have enough time to continue on the android project as it needs lot of setup until I can test my applications. Continued coding on HackerRank by solving the Closed Brackets-Challenge. 
My C++ has also faded a lot but I begin to remember. Solved the challenge in a way that most Test Cases run smoothly. I don't know why the others don't work, their setup is to huge to check it manually. 
Perhaps I'll continue with the android stuff tomorrow. 

**Thoughts** Tackling the 100days of code challenge besides a 40hrs work week is challenging enough. The additional setup as for android takes even more time. This is hard for me.

### Day 3: January 10, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Forced myself to continue with this callenge though it will cost lots of sleep... Reawakening some knowledge about string and string operations in C++. My coding still feels very stubborn and I don't know how to improve it. 

**Thoughts**This challenge will cost me some sleep in the long run and I need some days with more free time in order to do a proper setup for android if I want to continue on a real project instead of HackerRank.

### Day 4: January 11, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Dived into Regex to split a string up. Totally overkill but interesting nevertheless. 
**Thoughts**: Today I would have like to spend the time for other things but I still kept doing the challenge ... tomorrow then...
